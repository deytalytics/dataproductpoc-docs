# Enterprise Data Catalogue / Data Governance Tool

1 of the key principles of data mesh and treating data as a product is the need for federated data governance teams who are responsible for:-
  * defining metadata & documentation for data that relates to the area of the business that they are responsible for.
  * defining data quality rules which ensure that the data provided by the data product is trustworthy.

The enterprise data catalogue is a data governance tool that provides the following functionality for the purposes of data products/data mesh:-

1. Create, View & Update data product & dataset metadata
2. Create, View & Update Technical Data Quality Rules
