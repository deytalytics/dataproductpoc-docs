# Improving Data Quality

A data product will have data quality rules defined in the data governance tool (collibra) by a data governance team that is familiar with the data that needs to be cleansed.

IT can then convert these into technical data quality rules which can be configured in the data product admin website and uploaded to the data product via the [control endpoint](dp-data-quality.md)

Data governance teams working in different areas of the business will benefit from being able to see other team's output in the [data marketplace](data-marketplace.md).
