# Data Modeling Tool

![data dictionary example](https://dataedo.com/asset/img/kb/glossary/sample_data_dictionary_extended.png)
As part of the documentation, it is desirable to link to data models including a data dictionary so that an 
application developer or business user is able to understand what data is stored in the data product.
The data modeling tool needs to be able to provide online accessible documentation to achieve this. 
The optimal solution is if the data modeling tool provides an online portal but often those are cost-prohibitive. 
Another method that is typically provided is to be able to generate a documentation website which then just needs to be 
hosted in the cloud.
