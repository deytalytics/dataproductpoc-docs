# Data Product - Discovery Endpoint

The purpose of a discovery endpoint is so that a human being and a machine should be able to discover information and documentation
about the data product from the data product itself. 

For human beings, the information should be supplied as a web page with the following information made available:-
* Name
* Version
* How to get secure access to the data product
* Link to a data lineage diagram
* Link to a data model
* Link to a data sharing agreement
* Link to a data consumption agreement
* Link to a data dictionary
* In the case of a REST API, the standard docs should be available allowing a web developer to see what 
  query and field parameters are available and allowing them to be able to test secure access to the output data port

For machines, the same information should be available as a JSON file
