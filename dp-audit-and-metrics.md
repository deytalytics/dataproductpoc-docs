# Metrics and Auditing
In order to check that a data product is well utilised and is secure, metrics and audit information should be captured by the data product and stored in a relational database.

Metrics and audit metadata should be captured from traffic information sent by the data consumer.
For example, if the data consumer called a REST API then information can be stored about:-

* Consumer's IP address
* Requested API endpoint address
* The GET/POST request
* Timestamp
