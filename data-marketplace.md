# Data Marketplace

In order that data consumers can find data products, there needs to be a data marketplace. 

The data marketplace should be:-

1. Located in the cloud
2. Be secured
3. Group data products logically e.g. by system or business area 
4. Be searchable
5. Return a list of data products with links through to the documentation
6. The information supporting the data marketplace should be held in an online data store and be easily maintainable
