# Data Product Admin Website

The Data Product Admin Website is pitched at business facing data governance teams that want to be able to 
better manage the creation and maintenance of datasets which would be useful for the business.

Large organisations tend to have invested in data governance tools already (e.g. Axon, Collibra, Purview) and 
the data product admin is intended to augment these tools with additional functionality.

So if your data governance tool already allows you to easily create and maintain data product and dataset metadata and technical data quality rules then I'd recommend that you carry on using that tool for those functions.

The data product admin website as a minimum viable product (MVP) should provide the following functionality:-

1. The ability for a person with an administrator role to be able to login securely
2. It should be possible for the admin to perform the following tasks:-
   * Select a data product 
   * Create, View and update data source configuration information for the data product
   * Trigger pulling data in from a specific data source to the input data layer
   * Create, View and update pipeline SQL which will move data from the input data layer to the output data layer
