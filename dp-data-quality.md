# Improving Data Quality

A data product will have data quality rules defined in the data governance tool (collibra) by a data governance team that is familiar with the data that needs to be cleansed.

IT can then convert these into technical data quality rules which can be uploaded to the data product via the [control endpoint](dp-data-quality.md)

Data governance teams working in each segment/sub-segment will benefit from being able to see other team's output in the [data marketplace](data-marketplace.md).
For example, the Liquified Natural Gas data governance team will easily be able to see the metadata associated with Deal that has been implemented in a data product created by the Shell Energy North America team. Where there are differences, they can then collaborate to ensure that Deal is defined in a consistent way.
